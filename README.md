# Purify

`purify` is a Google Chrome extension which helps you to find quotes within an article. 
Inspired by one too many opinion pieces based around a sensationalized quote or two.

1. Open Google Chrome's context menu, then go to `Tools` -> `Extensions`
2. Drag the `chrome.crx` file and drop it on that page
3. Click "Add" and you'll see the extension icon appear to the right of the omnibar
