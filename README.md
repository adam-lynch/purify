# Purify

`purify` is a JavaScript extension for Chrome which helps readers find quotes within an article. 
Inspired by one too many opinion pieces based around a sensationalized quote

### To-do
The extension is very alpha. Current tasks and future work can be found on the [purify Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dg4xZrfO). Feel free to sign up, add a task or assign yourself a task to work on
